    "description": "I was hired to complete the current CSX Carbon Capture project after the current developer left.  This was developed in ReactJs using TypeScript, Redux, AWS and Postgres.  As the project was still in an MVP state, my day-to-day work is working with the structure and implementation of the code to bring it to a production-ready application.  This has required a lot of refactoring as the MVP had been produced on a very short time scale.  Also, as MDRxTech was effectively a new part of the Mishcon group, I also had a part in consulting on processes such as agile and some architectural decisions.",
